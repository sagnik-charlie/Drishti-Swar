## Problem Overview


Blindness presents significant challenges for individuals affected by this condition, but technology can offer assistance in various daily activities. The current project aims to create a photo-to-speech application tailored for the visually impaired. Named Drishti Swar, this initiative seeks to empower individuals with visual impairments to navigate independently without external aid. The underlying philosophy of this project is to foster societal inclusivity by providing visually impaired individuals with tools to enhance their autonomy. Through a combination of image and text processing, we have developed a deep learning application that serves as a valuable resource for the visually impaired.
